<h3>Task Description</h3>
<p>Your task is to evaluate the quality of a translation from English to Ukrainian in two successive stages:
fluency and adequacy.</p>

<h3>Stage 1: Fluency Evaluation</h3>
<p>You will be shown <strong>only the Ukrainian translation</strong>. Rate on a 0–100 scale the extent to which the
translation is well-formed grammatically, contains correct spellings, adheres to common use of terms, titles,
and names, is intuitively acceptable, and can be sensibly interpreted by a native speaker.</p>

<h4>Fluency Scale</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>0–25:</strong> Incomprehensible</li>
	<li><strong>25–50:</strong> Disfluent</li>
	<li><strong>50–75:</strong> Good</li>
	<li><strong>75–100:</strong> Flawless</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stage 2: Adequacy Evaluation</h3>
<p>After completing the fluency assessment, you will be shown <strong>both the English source and the Ukrainian
translation</strong>. Rate how much of the meaning expressed in the source text is also expressed in the target
translation.</p>

<h4>Adequacy Scale</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>0–25:</strong> None</li>
	<li><strong>25–50:</strong> Little</li>
	<li><strong>50–75:</strong> Most</li>
	<li><strong>75–100:</strong> All</li>
</ul>
