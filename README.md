# vulyk-fluency-adequacy

Vulyk plugin for fluency and adequacy evaluation of translations.

Evaluators assess translations in two successive stages:

1. **Fluency** — only the Ukrainian translation is shown. Rate how well-formed the translation is (0–100).
2. **Adequacy** — both source and translation are shown. Rate how much meaning is preserved (0–100).
